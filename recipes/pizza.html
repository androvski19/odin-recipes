    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The most delicious pizza needs the best tomato sauce right? Here's a completely homemade sauce for your store-bought or homemade pizza dough.</p> 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1800 grams plum tomatoes (or two 28-ounce cans whole peeled plum tomatoes)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, peeled and cut in half</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>Store-bought fresh pizza dough</li>
    </ul>
    
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>If using fresh tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Fill a large bowl halfway-full with ice cubes and cold water. Using a sharp knife, cut a ¼-inch deep X on one end of each tomato. Place the scored tomatoes into the boiling water and cook until you see the skin starting to wrinkle and split, 1 to 2 minutes (be careful not to cook too long, or the tomatoes will become soft and difficult to handle). Using a slotted spoon, lift the tomatoes out of the pot and plunge them into the ice-cold water bath. Let sit for a few minutes to cool, then transfer the tomatoes to a cutting board and, using your hands, peel off their skins.</li>
        <li>Cut the tomatoes into ½-inch chunks (discard the cores at this point) and transfer them, along with all of their juices, into a Dutch oven or saucepan.</li>
        <li>To the chopped tomatoes, add the butter, olive oil, onions, garlic, salt, and sugar. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1½ to 2½ hours, stirring occasionally and mashing the tomatoes, until the sauce is no longer watery. Remove and discard the onions. Using a wooden spoon or potato masher, mash any large chunks of tomatoes and garlic to make a slightly chunky and thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Before serving, stir in the basil.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200ºC</li>
        <li>Place store-bought pizza dough on a dedicated pan or parchemnt oven tray</li>
        <li>Spoon some sauce on top until desired</li>
        <li>Put your prefered toppings</li>
        <li>Put in the oven until it has gained colour</li>
    </ol>
